# Welcome to Quinn Gets Sassy

This is my first test of using this kind of repository design so we'll see how
this goes.

Basically I am learning new technology and I will use GitHub pages to document
my progress.

In this repository I am looking into SASS, for more verbose descussion of what I
am doing as well as my progress lease check out my website for this repository
at (I need a link to the repo)

## Installation

If you would like to see my work I will provide instructions in
the future.
