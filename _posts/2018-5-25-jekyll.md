# [The Beginning](#Beginning)

I've been developing for awhile now and after taking some advice from some colleagues
I have decided to start tracking what I am working on. So I will start tracking what
I work on and learn here.

*Sweet short simple and to the point good start, go me.*

In the future I might make this site my main github.io profile site. For now I will
take Jekyll on a test drive and see how I feel about it.

<a name="Introduction">
## [Introduction](#Introduction)

For my first post I wanted to go through how this site came to be / what I learned /
first impressions ect.

I started off wanting to build up a website using my normal tech stack on the web.
At the time of writing this my tech stack on the web is primarily Node.js on the
backend and React.js on the frontend. After doing some research into the topic of
having a blog I encountered Jekyll. Having never heard of Jekyll and being a naturally
curious person I took a look into it

## Background

So Jekyll is a static site generator. Basically, it turns static files into more amazing
static files. If you want to learn more about Jekyll I recommend reading the
[welcome to Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) as it will explain it far better than I.

I decided to use Jekyll as I don't want to spend too much time mantaining the site itself.
I would instead like to focus on learning and building things with the new tech that I learn.
For that reason since GitHub supports Jekyll right out of the box I went with that option.

## [Setup](#Setup)

So the setup for hosting the site is quite simple I followed the directions
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).
The challenges I encountered with the setup mostly came after I had set up the hosting on
Github Pages.

After setting up one of Githubs supported [themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
I wasn't quite satisfied with any of them. So I explored the Jekyll community and
found [this one](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).
I thought it would be a good starting place for me to get my feet wet and I do plan to
overhaul the design once I find my footing in Jekyll.

<a name="Completed">
## [Tasks Completed](#Completed)

Today was mostly focused on the learning side of things. With that said I want to focus on
near daily progress toward whatever I am attempting to learn or improve upon.

Here is the work that has been accomplished in today's developer life of Quintin Donnelly.

- Finished the set up of the Jekyll template
- Set up the contact page to send me emails from the Jekyll site

<a name="Conclusion">
## [Conclusion](#Conclusion)

Building and maintaining this site provides me with multiple opportunities. For one
I will get to learn new technology (Like Jekyll) as well as nontechnical things such
as my writing skills (I am impressed if you made it this far and I am sorry for your
struggle)
